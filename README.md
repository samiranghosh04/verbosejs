# verbosejs
Verbose JS is a verbose, pre revenue, post code, post vision, Javascript UI library created for the memes. To put it simply Verbose JS is like a jQuery alternative, but significantly worse and unlike jQuery it is actually verbose lol. On a serious note, this was created just to understand how to create JS libraries, packages and OSS projects.
