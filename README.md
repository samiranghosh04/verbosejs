# verbosejs
Verbose JS is a verbose, pre-revenue, pre-code, pre-vision, JavaScript UI library created for memes. To put it simply Verbose JS is like a jQuery alternative, but significantly worse, and unlike jQuery it is actually verbose lol. On a serious note, this was created just to understand how to create JS libraries, packages, and OSS projects.
